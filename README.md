# Tabletop Ising Model
Physics visualization morphed into a small game where you get to explore the behaviour of the 2D Ising model. Playable on https://xyalice.itch.io/ising-model.  
  
Used as a playground to play with the Unity3D ML agents package https://github.com/akoreman/Tabletop-Ising-AI.  
  
Models made using ProBuilder, textures made using InkScape.
  
Uses the following font https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/free-pixel-font-thaleah-140059 .
